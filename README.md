DISC: A TTID Installation
=========================

To pundits and talking heads it was just a good sound bite. To programmers it
was a nuisance. Normal folks believed whatever they wanted to believe. Only the
kooks and conspiracy theorists got it right.

On January 1st, 2000 at 00:00 hours, the local time on a military training
program reset to a long string of zeroes. Whirring away in its home in a
bunker, the Cold War computer couldn’t make heads or tails of late millenial
politics in the context of the beginning of UNIX time: January 1, 1970.

And so, the program safely, and without any connection to any actual
thermonuclear capability... executed. A naive subroutine decided the best
course of action was hell on earth. Launch them all. The whole nuclear arsenal.

It was just a training program, it should have been of no consequence. But the
program was infected with state-enemy-of-the-time malware program that couldn’t
tell the difference. And that program wrote home and warned of the incoming
barrage. So they struck first, and the comps had no choice but to
retaliate.

At least, that’s the way the old government tells it. According to the them,
the nukes were already on their way when they retaliated in kind. Regardless,
the result was the same. Y2K: Global theromonuclear annihilation.

Since then we’ve all but stopped keeping track of time. What would be the
point? All major metro areas leveled. And whatever computer systems we scrap
together keep failing each night at midnight. A reminder of our apocalypse,
like the echos of a fatal gunshot ringing off into the night.

Cheers.
